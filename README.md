# Bindr
Like Tinder, but for finding a study partner. Pronounced like "binder".

This application was developed for the purposes of the Software Engineering course at Rutgers University, New Brunswick
The application authors are:
Kevin Cadavillo, Jack Wu, Feiying Zheng, and Jake Zhou

After a session of brainstorming, the team decided with Jack's idea of a Tinder for studying app. While you can review the application's problem statement and scope in the Deliverables folder, under the SRS, I will give a brief description here.
As computer science students, we often need to pair or group ourselves with our peers for our course projects. However, we do not always know anyone in our course. Some of us have made the mistake of choosing a poor performing partner and wish there was a way to avoid this problem. That is why we proposed to develop an app that would give you some information about a potential project partner or study buddy, and it would allow both users to decide if they would like to chat with the other user.

As we are all students in our senior year taking multiple courses, this application lacks some features we believe to be essential for real world use. This includes a secure login system, secure user data, and a self sufficient chat system, and an administrative entity. However, we have designed our project to be scalable and understand that shall one or some of us decide to continue development, we have a solid foundation.
